# How To's - A few extra things you can do with Sensor Modules

We would like to enable you to make the most of your WunderBar Sensor Modules. 
This section includes a couple of extra cool things that you could do with your sensors besides using them as sensors. 

You now have the option of [using the modules as iBeacons](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/HowTos/iBeacons), [connecting the Grove module to Arduino](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/HowTos/Arduino) and [replacing the existing firmware](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/HowTos/Flashing) on the them.

These are only the first extra features in place, stay tuned for additional amazing features!
